    <h2>NOTABLE EVENTS NOTICED</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Recently, Specex founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
      and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg
      have been having a heated online debate over the
      future of Artificial Intelligence(AI). So far,
      Musk has been winning the public's faith, and
      for a good reason. Here are some excerpts from
      the argument.<br><br>
      Musk:<br>
      “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal,” he said, adding that the technology represents a “fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.”<br><br>
      Commentor at a Zuckerberg Q&amp;A:<br>“I watched a recent interview with Elon Musk and his largest fear for the future was AI. What are your thoughts on AI and how it could affect the world?”<br><br>
      Zuckerberg:<br>“I have pretty strong opinions on this ... I think you can build things and the world gets better, and with AI especially, I’m really optimistic. I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I think it is pretty irresponsible.”

    <h3>1st. KOALAS</h3>
    Conservation Status:<br>
    <img src="Screen%20Shot%202017-08-13%20at%202.03.36%20PM.png" width=250 length=150><div><br><p>
    Scientific classification:<br>
    Kingdom:	<i>Animalia<br></i>
    Phylum:	<i>Chordata<br></i>
    Clade:	<i>Synapsida<br></i>
    Class:	<i>Mammalia<br></i>
    Infraclass:<i>Marsupialia<br></i>
    Order:	<i>Diprotodontia<br></i>
    Family:	<i>Phascolarctidae<br></i>
    Genus:	<i>Phascolarctos<br></i>
    Species:	<i>P. cinereus<br></i>
    The koala (<b>Phascolarctos cinereus</b>, or,
    inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal
    herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is
    the only extant representative of the family
    Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives
    are the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat">wombats</a>.
    The koala is found in coastal areas of the
    mainland's eastern and southern regions,
    inhabiting <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland">Queensland</a></b>, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New South Wales</a></b>, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)">Victoria</a></b>,
    and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a></b>. It is easily recognisable by
    its stout, tailless body and large head with
    round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.
    The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in)
    and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.<br>

    <h3>2nd. PRAIRIE DOGS</h3>
    <p>
      Scientific Classification:<br>
      Kingdom:	<i>Animalia<br></i>
      Phylum:	<i>Chordata<br></i>
      Clade:	<i>Synapsida<br></i>
      Class:	<i>Mammalia<br></i>
      Order:	<i>Rodentia<br></i>
      Family:	<i>Sciuridae<br></i>
      Tribe:	<i>Marmotini<br></i>
      Genus:	<i>Cynomys<br><br></i>
      Prairie dogs (genus <i><b>Cynomys</b></i>) are herbivorous burrowing rodents native to the grasslands of North America. The five species are: black-tailed, white-tailed, Gunnison's, Utah, and Mexican prairie dogs. They are a type of ground squirrel, found in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In Mexico, prairie dogs are found primarily in the northern states, which lie at the southern end of the Great Plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León, and northern Tamaulipas. In the United States, they range primarily to the west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. Despite the name, they are not canines.<br>
