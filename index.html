    <p>
      Recently, Specex founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
      and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg
      have been having a heated online debate over the
      future of Artificial Intelligence(AI). So far,
      Musk has been winning the public's faith, and
      for a good reason. Here are some excerpts from
      the argument.<br><br>

    <h3>1st. KOALAS</h3>

    Scientific classification:<br>
    Kingdom:	<i>Animalia<br></i>
    Phylum:	<i>Chordata<br></i>
    Clade:	<i>Synapsida<br></i>
    Class:	<i>Mammalia<br></i>
    Infraclass:<i>Marsupialia<br></i>
    Order:	<i>Diprotodontia<br></i>
    Family:	<i>Phascolarctidae<br></i>
    Genus:	<i>Phascolarctos<br></i>
    Species:	<i>P. cinereus<br></i>
    The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.<br>

    <h3>2nd. PRAIRIE DOGS</h3>
    Scientific Classification:<br>
    Kingdom:	<i>Animalia<br></i>
    Phylum:	<i>Chordata<br></i>
    Clade:	<i>Synapsida<br></i>
    Class:	<i>Mammalia<br></i>
    Order:	<i>Rodentia<br></i>
    Family:	<i>Sciuridae<br></i>
    Tribe:	<i>Marmotini<br></i>
    Genus:	<i>Cynomys<br><br></i>
    Prairie dogs (genus <i><b>Cynomys</b></i>) are herbivorous burrowing rodents native to the grasslands of North America. The five species are: black-tailed, white-tailed, Gunnison's, Utah, and Mexican prairie dogs. They are a type of ground squirrel, found in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In Mexico, prairie dogs are found primarily in the northern states, which lie at the southern end of the Great Plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León, and northern Tamaulipas. In the United States, they range primarily to the west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. Despite the name, they are not canines.<br>

    <center><h3>HOBBIES</h3></center>
    I enjoy many hobbies, such as building legos, making physics jokes, studying astronomy, etc.
    However, above all, after my friends and family, I love my silly willy old bears the most.<br>Some of my favorite jokes are:
    <ol>
      <li> A photon walks into a hotel and is asked if he needs help with his luggage. The photon says,"No, I'm <i>travelling light</i>!"</li>
      <li>I went to an ice cream shop with only quark style ice cream. They had Charm, Strange, Up, Down, Top, and Bottom! </li><br>
      here's one I found:<br><img src="Jokes-physics-student-can-laugh-No-Charge.png">
